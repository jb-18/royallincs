    <h4>Our Founder</h4>
    <p>Meet our founder, Schlaria Brown. A hardworking mother of two who went out on her own to start her own business. While it's a long story for why she went into this field, to put it simply, she wanted to help out the best way she can.</p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Schlaria Brown. I am the owner of Royallincs LLC. Which is a dispatching/freight transportation company. While researching the freight business, I found out that only 9.5% of truck drivers are women. And less than 5% of dispatchers are black women. My goal is to help expand not only women, but black women in the trucking business.</p>
