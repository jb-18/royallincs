    <h4>Our Founder</h4>
    <p>Meet our founder, Schlaria Brown. A hardworking mother of two who stands for what Royallincs represents. Royallincs proudly represents diversity in the transportation industry, offering a perspective and leadership style that values inclusivity, integrity, and community connection, qualities that resonate with today's shippers and drivers. We bridge the gap between truck drivers and shippers with personalized dispatching services that prioritize both efficiency and fairness. By understanding the needs of both sides, we foster strong, lasting partnerships. Our expertise in last-mile delivery, pharmaceuticals, and medical supplies means we handle shipments where speed, precision, and compliance are non-negotiable. Positioned to access key southern logistics corridors, our base offers fast reach to major highways, ports, and distribution centers, reducing delivery times and increasing reliability for clients. From refrigerated units for temperature-sensitive goods to secure vans for pharmaceuticals, our tailored fleet ensures the right equipment is matched to the right shipment every time. As a boutique transportation partner, we deliver the flexibility and responsiveness that large carriers can't match, while maintaining professional standards that meet or exceed industry regulations.</p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Schlaria Brown. I am the owner of Royallincs LLC. Which is a dispatching/freight transportation company. While researching the freight business, I found out that only 9.5% of truck drivers are women. And less than 5% of dispatchers are black women. My goal is to help expand not only women, but black women in the trucking business.</p>
